    Handle a new submission and generate social media content ideas.

    This endpoint accepts submission data for a local service or event in Asheville and processes it to create
    social media content ideas using an LLM (Language Learning Model).

    Parameters:
    - submission: A Submission object containing details about the service or event.

    Returns:
    - A SubmissionResponse object containing:
        - status: "success" if the submission was processed successfully
        - message: A brief message about the result of the operation
        - content_ideas: A list of ContentIdea objects (in future implementation)

    Future Enhancements:
    - Integration with an LLM to automatically generate social media content ideas based on the submission.
    - The generated content ideas will be tailored for different social media platforms.
    - Potential platforms include Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and LinkedIn.

    Note:
    Currently, this endpoint only acknowledges the receipt of the submission. 
    The LLM integration for content generation will be implemented in a future update.
